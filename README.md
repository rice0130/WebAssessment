# WebAssessment
Name: LIU MEI LING 

What did you like about this project?
A: This project gives me the chance to know how much I've already learned so far.
   I realize I am still not skilled in the coding and debugging. Need more practice!
What did you struggle with in this project?
A: I think is the flex block and RWD part. For flex block, I still can't control the item as I want it to do,
   always need to test and try command, and it waste a lot of time.I think I have to get to know more about it.
   RWD part also need a lot attention to redesign the layout, also took me a lot of time on it.
What would make your experience with this assessment better?
A: I think need to practice more effiecient way to coding, make the code simple and nice will be a good benefit
   when I develop the code.
